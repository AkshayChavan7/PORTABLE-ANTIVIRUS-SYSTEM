# PORTABLE-ANTIVIRUS-SYSTEM

Viruses, worms and other harmful programs are turning out to be an increasing threat to computer systems.They can cause severe damage and consume countless hours and system administration time. Once a computer device gets infected, it can cause other devices to get infected if the computer device is a part of a network. Researchers have come with different software programs that can scan such malicious programs and remove them from the system to avoid further infection or other malicious activity. Although it might look like an attractive solution, general users find it quite costly. Also, if the user wants to scan a different computer system, then he/she needs to purchase separate software. To handle this problem, we have developed software that can be reused on multiple devices and perform the same task. So, Portable Antivirus System is a portable tool which can reside in any portable storage device and can scan the computer system for any malicious programs.
